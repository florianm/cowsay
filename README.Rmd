### What is this?

If you are familiar with `cowsay` on the cli, then you know what this is, but for R.  If not, read below.  Why?  Why not?

That's right, it takes 10 people to make `cowsay` - it's that hard.

### Where to find ASCII animal art

Sources to look in:

* http://www.retrojunkie.com/asciiart/asciiart.htm - apprently this person just collects ascii art, doesn't make any,
* http://www.chris.com/ascii/ - again, this person only collects them - no mention of license, permissions, etc.
* http://www.asciiworld.com/

Permissions

In the [ascii art mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/alt.ascii-art) they say:

```
 As for posting other people's ASCII art,
    after a discussion in news:alt.ascii-art       _     ___
    the following rules were agreed upon:         #_~`--'__ `===-,
    1.  If an ASCII ART picture has initials      `.`.     `#.,//
        on it, leave them on when posting it      ,_\_\     ## #\
    2.  If an ASCII ART picture doesn't have      `__.__    `####\
        initials on it,  mention  that  you            ~~\ ,###'~
        didn't  draw  it  when  posting  it.              \##'
    3.  If somebody  posts a picture without                  [nosig]
        initials and you have an original copy
        with initials on, feel free to re-post the original version.
        *   The re-post ought not to be taken personally, as we all
            know that ASCII art often loses proper credits.
            Responses to the re-post are not necessary.

    One contributor, name of Krogg, suggested the following:

    1.) Ultra polite:...ya make yer own ascii and use it.
    2.)  Very polite:...Ya contact the author and ask if ya
                        can use it...
    3.)       polite:...Ya use it but you keep the Credits
                        in there like they should be.
    4.)         rude:...Ya use it and strip credits.
    5.)    Very rude:...Ya use it and claim that it Is
                        _Your_ very own creation...
```

So, let's go with this rule: Let's include found (on the web) ascii art in this pkg, include signature if there, and if no signature, put in a `[nosig]` (see above).

```

### Using pipes

```{r}
library("magrittr")
"I HAD FUN ONCE, IT WAS AWFUL" %>% say('grumpycat')
```

### I just want the animals!

Okay, hold your endless horses. Just use the exported vector `animals`, and you can select the animal you want by name.

```{r}
animals['clippy']
```
